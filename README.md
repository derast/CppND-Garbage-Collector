# CppND-Garbage-Collector
The final project for this Memory Management course is to implement your own version of a smart pointer. You can think of this as implementing your own garbage collector,to use a concept from other programming languages. Building this project will help you understand both how to work with pointers and references, and also why smart pointers are so important to modern C++ programming. Complete the implementations and verify that your implementation does not have any memory leaks!

## Project TODO List:
- Complete `Pointer` constructor   ***DONE***
- Complete `Pointer` `operator==`  ***DONE***
- Complete `Pointer` destructor    ***DONE***
- Complete `PtrDetails` class   ***DONE***


## Plus
- Cmake project structure
- C++ namespace sp
- C++ interface and implementation refactor for classes(ADT)

## Steps to compile and run
- cd build
- cmake ..
- make
- cd ../bin/ && ./smart_pointer.bin
